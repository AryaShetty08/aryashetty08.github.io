title: "PUF Modeling Attacks"
description: "<strong>March 2025 - May 2025</strong><br>


              <strong>Technology Components: PUF, Hardware Security, Python, Machine Learning, Linear Regression, Perceptron, Neural Network</strong><br><br>
              
              
                I designed a modular machine learning pipeline in Python for testing PUF security, allowing easy integration of new models and attack strategies. I built feature extractors for Arbiter, XOR, and Lightweight PUFs to improve model understanding of internal architectures. I also coducted multiple tests on a variety of chains and challenge-response data, to compare findings with other papers.
