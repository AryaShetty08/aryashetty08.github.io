              <strong>Technology Components: Perlmuttter, Delta, Linux, Python, Slurm, SSH, Virtual Box, Minecraft</strong><br><br>
              
              
                Developed a reinforcement learning agent to complete Minecraft tasks by designing reward-based training mechanisms. Collaborated with a team of 5 to collect and label datasets from BASALT MineRL competitions, fine-tune pre-trained models, experiment with hyperparameters, and evaluate performance. Leveraged Perlmutter and Delta supercomputers to accelerate training using data parallelism techniques. Attached is the github we based our training upon OpenAI's VPT, and out github which includes some of the scripts we made for training and labelling.
