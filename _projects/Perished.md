              <strong>Technology Components: Unity, C#, Blender</strong><br><br>
              
              
                Worked with a small team to publish a demo and Steam page for our game <strong>The Perished</strong>. Started off as a game jam, we continued developing in Unity and were able to create a small demo to showcase at Rutger's Firside Showcase event. Powered with Unity, we made custom assets in blender for characters and objects, created monster AI, and reocrded cutscenes.
