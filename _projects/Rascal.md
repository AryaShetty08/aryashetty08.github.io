                This project presents RASCAL: Robotic Autonomous Scale Car for Adaptive Learning, a 1/15 scale 3D-printed car platform designed to be reproducible and precise. RASCAL mimics real car dynamics through its Ackermann steering and differential drive. I worked on this project with my summer 2024 WINLAB team as well as for my senior design Capstone project. It aims to prove RASCALâ€™s viability as a self-driving platform by designing and streamlining an entire self-driving pipeline with an interface for data collection and labeling, the ability to manage and experiment with multiple neural network models, and an integrated driving simulation for model testing and evaluation. Our interface also supports real-time interaction, allowing the runtime instance to pass decisions to the user to make high-level driving decisions.
