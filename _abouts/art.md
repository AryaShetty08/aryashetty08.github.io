description: "
                Developed an augmented reality (AR) art application where users share paintings and sculptures in real-time locations across the world. Powered with the Unity engine, and used an MQTT broker for communication protocols. Established with a publisher-subscriber architecture, uploads the user's drawing assets and receives other players' assets through one server. Successfully ran tests for multiple users to collaborate and work on pieces together. Part of the WINLAB Summer Program, the code is under WINLAB's GitLab.
