description: "
                I've been drawing ever since I was in elementary school, and I even got to paint one of the walls of my middle school. At the start of college, I decided to take things more seriously and bought a sketch tablet and more drawing supplies. Ever since then, in my free time, I have been learning more drawing techniques and have started making stand-alone pieces. Here you can see some of the stuff I have made.
